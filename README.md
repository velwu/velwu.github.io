# velwu.github.io

This is a newly repository which serves multiple purposes:
1. Storage for ongoing assignments as part of the ongoing Master of Science in Information Management, University of Illiois at Urbana-Champaign (MSIM, UIUC)
2. Archive for previous projects and assignments. This is for the ease of advertising to potential employers
3. Place for collaborating with current MSIM UIUC classmates on group projects and assignments (when applicable). End results may be preserved or destroy when collaboration is complete.
